Open source software is a key ingredient of modern science. Hundreds of software packages, libraries, and applications have become essential tools. Whether it’s searching a genome sequence for a disease gene, counting cells in a microscope image, or tracking the evolution of an Ebola outbreak, software is critical to the work scientists do every day — and much of it is built by researchers who volunteer their time and effort to make their tools available and usable by others.
