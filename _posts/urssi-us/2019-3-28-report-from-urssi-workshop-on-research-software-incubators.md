title: Report from URSSI workshop on research software incubators
---

Summary At the first URSSI community workshop, a small group of participants started to discuss a model for incubating research software projects. Incubation in this context might include a structured program that helps developers plan a new community-based software project, or improve existing projects that need mentorship, strategy, or other resources in order to sustainably grow.
To further explore this topic we brought together 16 experienced funders, community managers, developers, researchers, and software users.
