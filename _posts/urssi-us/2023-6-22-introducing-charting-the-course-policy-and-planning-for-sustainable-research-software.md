Hello research software community!
In this blog post, I am going to introduce myself and the research software policy project I am working on with Professor Daniel S. Katz at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (and Principal Investigator of the project).
I am a social scientist with 20+ years of professional experience working on social, policy and institutional aspects of science and technology.
