title: Software Sustainability in the Molecular Sciences
---

The molecular sciences — including chemistry, materials, biophysics and biochemistry — have a long history of developing software to answer core scientific questions. The field also has a long history of challenges to software sustainability. This blog post discusses some of the software sustainability challenges and the opportunities/possible solutions that the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) is working toward with the molecular sciences software development community.
The MolSSI is an NSF-funded project that is a nexus for science, education, and cooperation for the global computational molecular sciences community.
