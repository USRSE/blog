title: It's a Jungle Out There
---

<p>I’ve been fairly obsessed with watching the show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monk_(TV_series)" target="_blank">Monk</a>, and naturally
that coincided with having the theme song on infinite repeat in my brain at pretty
much all hours of the day. But it was good for creativity because it inspired me to
write a modified version, but instead of focusing on general anxiety about life,
focusing on anxiety about programming. Here it is!</p>

<p>It’s a Jungle Out There<br />
Spaghetti code is everywhere<br />
No one seems to care<br />
But I do<br />
Hey who’s in charge here<br />
It’s a jungle out there<br />
Bugs in the very code we use<br />
Do you know the permissions that you’re giving?<br />
Well I do, and it’s amazing<br />
People think I’m crazy, ‘cause I worry all the time<br />
If you paid attention, you’d be worried too<br />
You better pay attention<br />
All those projects we love so much might just hack you.<br />
I could be wrong now, but I don’t think so!<br />
Cause there’s a jungle out there.<br />
Get a research software engineer!<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>And in true dinosaur holiday spirit, I recorded a few videos and squashed them together
into an even larger monstrosity. The entire thing is hugely terrible,
but maybe that’s one reason I like it so much :) Enjoy!</p>
