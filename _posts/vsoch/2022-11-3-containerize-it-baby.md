title: Containerize It, Baby!
---

<p>I’ve just submit my <a href="https://twitter.com/vsoch/status/1588215058009464832" target="_blank">entry</a> to the HPC Guru Elevator Pitch Contest for the Supercomputing 2022 conference!</p>



<p>I’m fairly sure (like many of these contests) it will be a politically correct winner - someone that is best appealing
to the conference, but I’ll take a stand right now that I think my submission is tops in terms of creativity
and excited energy! I mean, there is just no alternative when it comes to technologies I’m excited about.</p>

  <p>Containerize it, baby!</p>

<p>Regardless of the outcome of this contest, I feel like I’ve already won - I’ve had so much fun making this and sharing with the community! 🎉️</p>
