title: AskCI Server- Collaborative and version controlled knowledge base
---

<p>Documentation is not remotely sexy. And <a href="https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/1961" target="_blank">according</a> 
to the Journal of Open Source Software, if you invest time and thought into a version controlled
documentation server that could serve researchers in so many ways, it is not research software.</p>

</div>

<p>I tried to give the many examples (other than providing documentation for researchers,
or a place for a center or group to collborate on documentation) of ways that it could
actually be used to help with research. Having automation and an API for programmatic access
to data is pretty useful, if you ask me:</p>

</div>

<p>But as you can see, it was rejected. I was really heart broken. It wasn’t just
because I had worked for weeks on a project that I was passionate about, it was because
I truly believed it could be useful. It was because someone else was telling me that
something I knew to be research software <strong>was not research software</strong>.
I want to talk about this a bit. If you don’t want to read, then I’ll give the summary
of my story - we need to advocate for our work and seek out review when other’s won’t
help us, and for that reason I’ve <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05973" target="_blank">published the paper </a>
on ArXiv. I am so grateful to this platform for giving my software a voice.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-research-software">What is research software?</h2>

<p>According to the conversation I had with JoSS, research software must be citable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of our rules of thumb about software being in scope is whether someone might cite it, and if so who.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this definition, a tool that serves as a data API for almost any kind of data
(that is version controlled) would be citable. So that couldn’t have been the whole story,
because it was rejected. The reviewer added more later, after meeting with his secret
panel of experts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I brought your response back to the editorial board for some more discussion, and then I was on break. Unfortunately, the consensus is still that this submission falls outside our scope of research software (using our definition). We don’t question that it looks useful for researchers, but fundamentally it doesn’t appear to be a tool that would be directly used for scholarly research and likely to be cited as part of the research process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The part that hit me was that software worthy of this label <strong>would be directly used for scholarly research</strong>.
That implicitly says to me that any kind of work that isn’t directly answering some
domain-specific research question “scholarly” is not research software. That implicitly
says to me that the only way I can publish to support my own career or get the attention
of my users, the academic community, is to bootstrap on someone else’s scholarly work.
That implicitly says to me that there is really no existing avenue for a research
software engineer to publish research software unless it fits in the mold of domain
research. But… containers? workflow managers? GNU utils? Git? And what about the inordinate numbers of tools
that are out there that <strong>indirectly</strong> are a game changers for the
same scholarly research?</p>

<p>My strong inclination is that the majority of folks on this panel think about
research software as data science tools. If I look across the JoSS, this is
the kind of work that I intend to see - R, Python, and containers intended for
directly doing data science. It’s not to say that these are not research software,
but as more of a generalist developer, I see this definition extremely limiting.
I should be able to write software that goes against the grain (e.g., I’m unlikely to get
grant money for a documentation server that is beat out by much sexier sounding projects,
if I could even apply for grants) that I know to be useful for
researchers, and be able to publish it. I’m hugely troubled that the “Journal of Open
Source Software” is not really supporting open source developers that are developing
software for research. It’s supporting researchers and data scientists that open
source their tools. These two things are different. If I defined research software,
and scoped for the Journal of Open Source software, I’d say that it’s open source
software developed with the sole intention to directly or indirectly improve the 
practices of research.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-cultural-implications">What are the cultural implications?</h2>

<p>What JoSS doesn’t realize is that it hurts the overall community to not support
research software engineers and their work. It hurts just enough to make me less likely
to work on a tool that I think is important, because whether we like it or not,
publication is still the best way to get researcher attention for feedback and usage.
It means that, over time, small groups of people in power (the committee at JoSS) get
to make decisions for us about what defines research software. It’s really no different
than people in positions of power presenting a very narrow definition of research
software engineer. If you aren’t upset about this, you should be.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>

<p>You can’t argue with someone in a higher place than you about what you believe if
they make the choices, and you’ve been rejected. I reached out to several
other journals, and despite each taking upwards of many hours to redo LaTex formatting,
it was rejections all around. The culture is not set up or ready to support generalist
open source software projects that aren’t aimed at data science directly, but might provide
an infrastructure to improve the practice or metadata behind some kind of research.</p>

<p>I’d like to hear others’ thoughts on what is research software, if you’ve been
in a situation like mine, and if so, what can be done. With no choices left, I’ve
decided to write this post and publish my work on ArXiv where it will
likely be forgotten. But that’s 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05973" target="_blank">better than nothing </a>
because I have more pressing things to work on than trying to convince some small
panel that my work is worthy. The greatest success here is, when you believe in
something, continuing to advocate for your work even when others will not. I believe
that we can do better to support research software engineers, and their work.</p>
