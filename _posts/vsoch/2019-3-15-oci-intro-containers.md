title: OCI Series Part I- Introduction to Containers
---

<p>Hey friends! Iâ€™m <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/org/pull/9" target="_blank">working on
</a> creating base of documentation to teach you about the Open Container Initiative (OCI). The questions
that I want to tackle are:</p>

<ol class="custom-counter">
    <li>What is OCI?</li>
    <li>What projects are maintained by the community?</li>
    <li>How do I contribute to OCI?</li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically, I struggled with the last question, and wanted to create this content
(and a few fun videos!) to help answer that exact question. Without further adieu,
here is the first video, an introduction to OCI and the problems that containers
help to solve.</p>
