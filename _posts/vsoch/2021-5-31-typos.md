title: Spell Check with Typos
---

<p>I‚Äôm a stickler for good documentation, but there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm not great at
That thing is‚Ä¶ spell checking! üò±Ô∏è</p>

<p>The thing is, I write a lot of code and text without my glasses or contact lenses,
and thus rely on a lot of muscle memory to write just about anything. 
My eyes are fairly useless without correction so I‚Äôll miss an extra or missing letter.
This leads to a lot of embarrassment in the way of spelling errors, and I‚Äôve
had contributors open pull requests on my repos to say ‚ÄúNo, Vanessa,
repository is not spelled‚Ä¶ like that‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<div style="padding: 20px;">
  <a href="https://vsoch.github.io/assets/images/posts/rseng/repository.png"><img src="https://vsoch.github.io/assets/images/posts/rseng/repository.png" /></a>
</div>

<p>I have no good response other than to say
‚ÄúWell, my fingers seemed to think that was an appropriate spelling for the word! üòÑÔ∏è</p>

<h2 id="typos">Typos</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/05/29/spell-checking-your-programming-from-the-linux-command-line/" target="_blank">saw a new project</a> that would be my savior - a Rust project called ‚Äútypos‚Äù that offered to check spelling, and even
correct it in place!  The only problem was that I needed to automate running
it with CI, so for one of this weekend‚Äôs projects I decided to <a href="https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/pull/267" target="_blank">add a GitHub action to do just that.</a>. And it works great! Here is the basics for
how to use it in your repository:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">vsoch-check-spelling</span>

<span class="na">on</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">push</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">branches</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">master</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">pull_request</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[]</span>

<span class="na">jobs</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">formatting</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">runs-on</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">ubuntu-latest</span>
    <span class="na">steps</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">uses</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">actions/checkout@v2</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Check for typos</span>
        <span class="na">uses</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">crate-ci/typos@1.0.4</span>
        <span class="na">with</span><span class="pi">:</span> 
          <span class="na">files</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">./_posts</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could also do multiple folders or files, like</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>          <span class="na">files</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">./_posts ./docs ./README.md</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you can add a ‚Äú_typos.toml‚Äù to the repository with settings for words to ignore.
<a href="https://github.com/vsoch/vsoch.github.io/pull/25/files" target="_blank">Take a look</a> at all the typos that were caught here!
and for <a href="https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/pull/367/files" target="_blank">Singularity Registry Server</a>!
If you want to learn more about the typos project, see <a href="https://github.com/crate-ci/typos" target="_blank">crate-ci/typos</a>
or read about <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/typos-action" target="_blank">the action on the GitHub marketplace</a>.</p>

<p>And when you are running it locally and want to preview and then write changes? It‚Äôs as simple as:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># preview changes</span>
./typos _posts

<span class="c"># write changes in place</span>
typos _posts/ <span class="nt">--write-changes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That‚Äôs all folks! The news on the street is that spell checking is cool and
automating it even cooler! I‚Äôm very excited about this project and am looking forward
to adding this step to check spelling in many of my documentation-rich projects.</p>
