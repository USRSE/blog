<p>I am Van. I am Van. Van-I-Am! <br /></p>

<p>Do you like clusters and Pam? <br /></p>

<p>I do not like them, Van-I-Am. <br />
I do not like clusters and Pam. <br />
I do not want to shell into a cluster. <br />
I do not want to use luste. <br />
I do not want them for my compute. <br />
I do not want them its done and moot! <br /></p>

<p>Do you like bash? <br /></p>

<p>I do not like bash, <br />
I feel like it‚Äôs always about to crash. <br />
I don‚Äôt want to deal with an escape or slash <br />
I do not want to create a hash, <br />
or store a container in a cache, <br />
And in fact I want to put it in the trash. <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them in the cloud? <br /></p>

<p>I would not like them in the cloud, <br />
no matter how snazzy or how loud. <br />
I am not monetarily endowed, <br />
nor do I want to render my finances plowed. <br />
No matter how you if‚Äôd and‚Äôd, or how‚Äôd, <br />
Your permissions error says I‚Äôm not allowed. <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them with AI? <br /></p>

<p>I would not like them with AI. <br />
I do not think they need to learn to lie. <br />
I would not like them with a brain, <br />
I would not like them to fly a plane, <br />
I do not want them to push to main. <br />
It is too much of a drain, <br />
and a bit more of a pain. <br /></p>

<p>What about machine learning? <br /></p>

<p>I do not want my machines to learn <br />
or the buzzword bullshit to twist and turn <br />
I do not have the yearning, <br />
to feel my computer burning <br />
Or have a conversation with someone about ‚ÄúML‚Äù <br />
Because really it‚Äôs something you are trying to sell <br />
and frankly I‚Äôd rather go to hell. <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them on a Mac? <br /></p>

<p>I would not like them on a Mac. <br />
I believe in honoring the headphone jack. <br />
I don‚Äôt care about your new M1 <br />
Because nothing on it can be done. <br />
The only thing that really wants to run <br />
is my patience, which is headed for the sun. <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them in an app? <br /></p>

<p>I would not like them in an app. <br />
I don‚Äôt want to install with snap. <br />
Or try your new packaged crap. <br />
Or fall into your nodejs Electron trap. <br />
Please add my crushing cynicism to your mental map. <br />
Because any kind of effort will simply flap. <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them with a bro? <br /></p>

<p>I would not like them with a bro. <br />
Just as much as I‚Äôd like to sit naked in the snow. <br />
I do not want him to preach me the laurels of tensorflow, <br />
or how whatever I‚Äôm doing is just too slow. <br />
Living in Silicon Valley does not make you know. <br />
But it might leave you in quite a low. <br />
Ruminating about all the lower cost places you could go! <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them here and now? <br />
Would you like them with a cow? <br /></p>

<p>I do not want them here and now. <br />
Or in the future or with a cow. <br />
If a cow learns to compute I‚Äôll be out of work <br />
and writing hateful posts about that dairy jerk <br />
But cheese is delicious who am I kidding? <br />
It‚Äôs us who should do the cow‚Äôs bidding. <br /></p>

<p>Would you like them with a display? <br />
Would you like them in the month of May? <br /></p>

<p>I do not like them in the cloud. <br />
I do not like them endowed. <br />
I do not like them with AI. <br />
I do not like them however sky high. <br />
I do not like them on a Mac. <br />
I do not like them with a snack. <br />
I do not like them on an app. <br />
I do not like them on a map. <br />
I do not like them with a bro. <br />
I do not like them in the snow. <br />
I do not want them here and now, <br />
I do not want them with a cow. <br />
I do not like clusters and Pam. <br />
I do not like them, Van-I-Am. <br /></p>

<p>Would you ssh from in a box? <br />
Would you ssh while wearing socks? <br /></p>

<p>Not in a box. Not wearing socks. <br />
Not with a display. Not in the month of May. <br />
I do not want them here and now, <br />
I do not want them with a cow. <br />
I do not like clusters and Pam. <br />
I do not like them, Van-I-Am. <br /></p>

<p>Would you? Could you? On a train? <br /></p>

<p>I would not, could not, on a train. <br />
Nor would I consider on a plane. <br />
And don‚Äôt ask me about in a car; <br />
I‚Äôd sooner drink myself silly at a bar. <br />
I do not want to waste my time, <br />
or edit documents with Sublime. <br />
Why do you pester me? <br />
Why can you not let me be? <br /></p>

<p>Please, just try them once, from your car! <br />
Shell in! Shell in! Here they are. <br /></p>

<p>I do not like them in the cloud. <br />
I do not like them soft or loud. <br />
I do not like them with AI. <br />
I do not like them with pie. <br />
I do not like them on a Mac. <br />
You‚Äôre going to give me heart attack! <br />
I do not like them on an app.  <br />
I do not like them with a frappe. <br />
A do not like them with a bro. <br />
I do not like them if they glow. <br />
I do not want them here and now, <br />
I do not want them with a sow. <br />
I do not want them in a box. <br />
I would not, could not, on a train. <br />
I would not, could not, on a plane. <br />
Can you see you are driving me insane? <br />
Not from my car! Not from a bar! <br />
I do not like clusters and Pam! <br />
I do not like them, Van-I-Am! <br /></p>

<p>You do not like them. So you say. <br />
Try them! Try them! And you may. <br />
Try them and you may, I don‚Äôt play. <br /></p>

<p>Van! If you let me be, <br />
I will try them. You will see. <br /></p>

<p>(‚Ä¶ ssh ‚Ä¶) <br /></p>

<p>Yes it is confirmed! I do not like clusters and Pam! <br />
I do not! I do not like them, Van-I-Am! <br /></p>

<p>It is so bad, so bad, you see! <br />
I‚Äôd rather go off and live in a tree. <br />
A box sounds nice to avoid this screen. <br />
Or a void of endless screams.  <br /></p>

<p>Say! I will despise them anywhere! <br />
I do so despise clusters and Pam! <br />
Thank you! Thank you, Van-I-Am. <br /></p>
